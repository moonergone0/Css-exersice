# Css-exersice
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

These are CSS exercises from the Odin project.
I am learning and moving forward with the help of these exercises. it is very fun to complete  all the exercises from the basis to little advance. I got to learn many new things and the unexpected challenges of the code I don't know was the very fun finding of that solution.

I am enjoying this very much and always looking forward to more challenges and fun projects like this.
